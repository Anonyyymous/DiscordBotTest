# DiscordBotTest
 trying to make a discord bot with a variety of functions

current functions:
>name counter,
>hunger games generator,
>timetable tracker

might add
>quote tracker, server response tracker; some servers will/won't have certain commands/responses, but only if more people want to use it on more servers


Kill methods/death methods are located in HungerGamesData.py, inside the environments dict. Probably not the best way to do it, i know. Feel free to add some more. The code has a thing for environment 'events' that i might add, such as the volcano erupting, but havent done that yet, and might just not.
